As a reminder this project forms 20% of your final grade.


# General Requirements
You are going to be defining some problem you are going to be solving with your code. I intentionally want to leave that up to you. The project should be network-related implementations, simulations, etc., based on what we have learned through the semester. Any programming language is fine. 

This project may be completed as a group of two or individually. If you are working in a group, the expectation is that the overall effort will reflect such. 

All artifacts, with the exception of the individual feedback sent via email, will be submitted via a group-specific Whitgit repository that will be set up once groups have been assigned. 

# Project Proposal
After some brainstorming, you will submit a project proposal for review. I will review your plan and give you a thumbs up or some suggestions. The proposals need to be submitted __before__ Friday 12/3/2021 at 11:59 PM.
â€ƒ
# Deliverables

The collection of your implementation and documentation is due by 12/14/2021 at 11:59 PM. Anything turned in after that time will not be graded. 

## Project Implementation
You will be graded on proper coding style. Your code must be readable and have good comments describing what is going on.  

Your code should line up with your documentation. All citations should be clearly marked and identified.

## Documentation
You will submit a document (.md, .docx, .pdf) in your final project repository that contains the following:
* Detailed description of what the project is attempting to do, the problem this project attempts to solve and/or a detailed purpose statement.
* An accounting of any assumptions made both when designing the project or when running the program. This could be things like a data format you are using or assumptions about the user's actions. 
* Detailed analysis, overview and justification of your design. Why did you develop your code the way you did? Does it do what you want it to do?  
* Manual for how to run your project in the form of a `README.md` file the repository folder.
* Works Cited. This includes any libraries used, any sources and any code utilized that was not specifically written for this project. These citations should be mirrored in your code.
  
This document should be 2-3 pages minimum. A single sentence for each of the above bullets is not what I am looking for.

# Presentation

During your section's final exam slot, you will participate in the presentation of these final projects. You are expected to show respect to your classmates and engage with their cool projects, as they are expected to engage with your presentation. 

Your presentation should:
* outline your project and what you made
* highlight the algorithmic points of your program
* include a demonstration of project running
  * This could be captured (screen shots, video) or live demo
* identify future work on the project
* reflection on the lessons learned developing code

Your presentation should not:
* be a code review. Selections of code are fine, but we don't need to see every line of code. We want to see results!

Each team will get ~10 minutes. You have a lot to cover: concise and clear presentations are necessary.  

Make sure all group members participate in the presentation.

# Individual Reflection

__If working in a group__: each group member will email the instructor (qmao@whitworth.edu)  an individual and confidential reflection of how the project went with a review of their group member before the Friday of finals week. This will be worth 5% of your overall project grade. You should answer the following in this email:
* How did the project go? What went well? What would you do differently?
* How was the project split? How did the pair programming work?
* Would you work with your group partner again? Were there any issues?
